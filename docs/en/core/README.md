# Core Technologies

::: tip
Version 5.2.6.RELEASE
:::

This part of the reference documentation covers all the technologies that are absolutely integral to the Spring Framework.

Foremost amongst these is the Spring Framework’s Inversion of Control (IoC) container. A thorough treatment of the Spring Framework’s IoC container is closely followed by comprehensive coverage of Spring’s Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technologies. The Spring Framework has its own AOP framework, which is conceptually easy to understand and which successfully addresses the 80% sweet spot of AOP requirements in Java enterprise programming.

Coverage of Spring’s integration with AspectJ (currently the richest — in terms of features — and certainly most mature AOP implementation in the Java enterprise space) is also provided.
