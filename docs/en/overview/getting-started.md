If you are just getting started with Spring, you may want to begin using the Spring Framework by creating a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)-based application. Spring Boot provides a quick (and opinionated) way to create a production-ready Spring-based application. It is based on the Spring Framework, favors convention over configuration, and is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

You can use [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a basic project or follow one of the ["Getting Started" guides](https://spring.io/guides), such as [Getting Started Building a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/). As well as being easier to digest, these guides are very task focused, and most of them are based on Spring Boot. They also cover other projects from the Spring portfolio that you might want to consider when solving a particular problem.
