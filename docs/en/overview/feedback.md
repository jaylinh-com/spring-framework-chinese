For how-to questions or diagnosing or debugging issues, we suggest using StackOverflow, and we have a [questions page ](https://spring.io/questions) that lists the suggested tags to use. If youâ€™re fairly certain that there is a problem in the Spring Framework or would like to suggest a feature, please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues).

If you have a solution in mind or a suggested fix, you can submit a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework). However, please keep in mind that, for all but the most trivial issues, we expect a ticket to be filed in the issue tracker, where discussions take place and leave a record for future reference.

For more details see the guidelines at the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), top-level project page.
