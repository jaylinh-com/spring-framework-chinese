When you learn about a framework, it’s important to know not only what it does but what principles it follows. Here are the guiding principles of the Spring Framework:

当学习一个框架时，不仅要知道框架能干什么也要知道框架遵循的原则，这点很重要。以下是 Spring Framework 的知道原则。


* Provide choice at every level. Spring lets you defer design decisions as late as possible. For example, you can switch persistence providers through configuration without changing your code. The same is true for many other infrastructure concerns and integration with third-party APIs.

* 提供任意层级的选择。Spring 允许你尽可能的推迟设计决策。例如，你可以在不改变代码的情况下通过配置切换持久层提供者。
其他的基础设置问题和对第三方 APIs 的整合也是如此。

* Accommodate diverse perspectives. Spring embraces flexibility and is not opinionated about how things should be done. It supports a wide range of application needs with different perspectives.
* 适应广泛的场景。Spring 提供强大的弹性，不局限于事物的具体实现。提供对基于不同场景的广泛的需求的支持。

* Maintain strong backward compatibility. Spring’s evolution has been carefully managed to force few breaking changes between versions. Spring supports a carefully chosen range of JDK versions and third-party libraries to facilitate maintenance of applications and libraries that depend on Spring.

* 保持较强的向后兼容性

* Care about API design. The Spring team puts a lot of thought and time into making APIs that are intuitive and that hold up across many versions and many years.

* Set high standards for code quality. The Spring Framework puts a strong emphasis on meaningful, current, and accurate javadoc. It is one of very few projects that can claim clean code structure with no circular dependencies between packages.
