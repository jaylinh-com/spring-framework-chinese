# 2.1. Introduction

Javaâ€™s standard `java.net.URL` class and standard handlers for various URL prefixes, unfortunately, are not quite adequate enough for all access to low-level resources. For example, there is no standardized `URL` implementation that may be used to access a resource that needs to be obtained from the classpath or relative to a `ServletContext`. While it is possible to register new handlers for specialized `URL` prefixes (similar to existing handlers for prefixes such as `http:`), this is generally quite complicated, and the `URL` interface still lacks some desirable functionality, such as a method to check for the existence of the resource being pointed to.
